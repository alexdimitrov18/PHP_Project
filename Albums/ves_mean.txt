Picking up where Transmissions left off, Vessels looks to continue that narrative by pushing boundaries to propel the listener into an “interconnected interzone” of four separate dangerous visions. The journey of Vessels takes the listener on a return to PROX (The “Back-up Earth” in Starset’s narrative that is the source of “The Message“) to an admonishment of the dangers of genetic engineering and into a near future where advances in artificial intelligence defy convenient notions of love, life and death.
