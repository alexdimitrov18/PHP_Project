Transmissions opens up with a robotic ‘prepare for takeoff’ instrumental “First Light” that opens the door to a Space Mountain-like adventure through what can be seen as the story of an intergalactic war. Of course it has the overly niche-y tracks like “It Has Begun” and “Antigravity”, but the rest of its tracks absolutely strong enough to hold their own. Its single “My Demons” and “Carnivore” are both anthem-like with lyrics that you can’t help but feel with every ounce of your being. It even has a few gloomy love songs in the mix (“Telescope” and “Let It Die”).
